# AWS

I do not want to enter credit card so... I've tried to self host aws compatible cloud :0

Unfortunately it it quite hard, found interesing tools and materials:
- https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-selfhosted-aws - how to self host aws))
- https://www.localstack.cloud/ - aws compatible debug service
- https://www.proxmox.com/ - actually, solution, but quite bulky and... i didnt like it

so, I end with everyone familiar s3 compatible... [MinIO](https://min.io/)
A bit of dances with drumm and it works. No public instance, sorry :)
Actually, I access server via vpn, since to lazy to setup it under reverse proxy. But actually, it is quire easy, since i've already host calendar sync and have '*.ebo.sh' domain certificate and minio support path access to buckets. Still... 

You may visit my site if you want) No sacral sence in domain name.
But, actually, I've just hosted some tetris game on main page, again, home server trough reverse proxy on public server. So... use desktop, controls are quite awful.
