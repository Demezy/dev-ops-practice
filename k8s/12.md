# Lab 12: Kubernetes ConfigMaps Implementation

## Task 1: Application Upgrade for Persistence

I've modified the application to include visit counting functionality. The application now:
- Tracks number of visits
- Stores the count in a `visits` file
- Exposes a `/visits` endpoint

## Task 2: ConfigMap Implementation

1. Created config.json in files folder with application configuration
2. Implemented ConfigMap in Helm chart
3. Added volume mounts for both config and visits persistence

### Deployment Verification

```bash
# Install Helm chart
helm install app-python ./app-python/

# Get pods
kubectl get pods
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
app-python-7fc7dd78f9-bx6nk   1/1     Running   0          42s

# Verify ConfigMap content
kubectl exec app-python-7fc7dd78f9-bx6nk -- cat /app/config.json
{
  "app_name": "python-time-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "development",
  "log_level": "INFO",
  "max_visits": 1000
}
```

## Implementation Details

1. Created ConfigMap from config.json file
2. Updated deployment.yaml to mount ConfigMap
3. Added volume for visits persistence
4. Configured proper paths and permissions

The implementation ensures:
- Configuration is separate from application code
- Visit count persists across pod restarts
- Clean separation of concerns
